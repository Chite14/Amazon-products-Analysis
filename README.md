## Project overview

In this project we are analysing sales of particular products on Amazon from a dataset made in the kaggle data science enviroment. It is an amazing dataset to work with as it wil give us the key performance indicators necessary for the growth of different shops. We will be using python with pandas to clean the data, and give more insight on the sales, ratings etc.

## Data Sources

[Download DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset)

## Tools used
- clean data using python with pandas using jupyter notebook
 - [Download here](https://anaconda.com)
- after cleaning of data we used seaborn visualization to give insights on the data for report. [Read Documentation here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- Data saved into excel from python for easy access

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer the key questions;

1. What is the overall average or sales trend or profit or depreciation?
2. which products sold the most?
3. what periods had peak sales, made most money?
4. Which products had the least ratings?

## Data Analysis

Include interesting code/ features worked with 

write python code used
```python
import pandas as pd
```

## Results and findings


## Recommendations

## Limitations

explain the what changes you made to data so they know weather information is reliable or not
